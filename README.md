## 💡 How It Works

1. **Typewriter Effect**  
   - Reveals a message character by character.  
   - Special characters trigger unique events:
     - `<` adds a line break.
     - `>` clears the text.
     - `|` switches to a romantic background and speeds up heart animations.
     - `9` sets a device-specific background image.

2. **Floating Hearts Animation**  
   - Smoothly animated hearts float across the screen.  
   - CSS keyframes handle the movement and fade-out effects.

3. **Dynamic Backgrounds**  
   - Triggered by specific characters, such as `|` and `9`, which change the background dynamically.  
   - Backgrounds are responsive and adjust for mobile and desktop displays.

4. **Background Music**  
   - The romantic song *"Em Sandeham Ledu"* plays in a continuous loop.  
   - Starts when the user interacts with the animation (e.g., clicking the "Hi" button).
